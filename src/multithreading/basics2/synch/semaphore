Semaphore is a class in java.util.concurrent package
semaphores are used to restrict number of threads access to a resource
semaphores maintain a set of permits through use of counter
to access the resource the thread muse be granted a permit from semaphore
if counter  > 0, access is allowed, if it is 0, access is denied
if counter > 0, permit is granted to resource and count is decremented
other wise the thread is block until a permit is acquired
thread releaes the permit when it no longer needs the resource and thereby increasing the counter
if a thread is waiting for permit, it will acquire permit and continue its execution

Example of semaphores
restricting number of connections to database
bounding a collection
