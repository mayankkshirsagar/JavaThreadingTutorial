Wait, notify and notifyAll are used for thread communication via a common object, this common object is considered
a medium for inter thread communication via these methods
these methods needs to be called from a synchronized context otherwise an illegalMonitorStateException is thrown

wait() : when you call wait on an object, it tells the thread to give up the lock and go to sleep state until some other
threads enter in same monitor and call notify or notifyAll. Wait basically release the lock and waits

notify(): when you call notify on an object, it wakes one thread waiting for the object, if multiple threads are waiting
for the object it will cal one of them. Depending on os implementation it will call one of the waiting threads.

notifyAll(): notifyAll() will wake all threads waiting on the object, which thread will be called first depends on thread
priority and os implementation
