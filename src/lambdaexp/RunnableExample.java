         * The Thread class has this constructor:
         *  public Thread(Runnable target)
         *  This constructor expects an object that implements the Runnable interface.
         *  In Java, a lambda expression like this,   () -> { .. }
         *  ...is treated as an instance of a functional interface â€” and Runnable is a functional interface
         * A functional interface has exactly one abstract method, so Java can infer that the lambda matches Runnable.run().
         *
         * Suppose hypothetically we had 2 constructors both accepting functional interfaces
         * public Thread(Runnable r) { ... }
         * public Thread(Callable c) { ... }
         * and we had new Thread(() -> { return 42; });
         * So you'd get a compiler error: "reference to Thread is ambiguous."
         * You'd have to explicitly cast the lambda:
         * new Thread((Runnable) () -> System.out.println("Runnable"));
